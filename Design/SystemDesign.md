       +------------------+
               |
    -------------------------------
   |        |        |        |
   v        v        v        v
Auth     Users    Orders   Payments
Service  Service  Service  Service
```

### ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

## 5. API Design
### ðŸ”¹ What is API Design?
API design involves creating standardized interfaces for services to communicate, ensuring usability, scalability, and security.

### ðŸ”¹ Best Practices
- **Versioning**: Use URL versioning (`/api/v1/users`) or headers to manage changes.
- **RESTful Principles**: Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and resources (e.g., `/users/{id}`).
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement OAuth 2.0, JWT, or API keys.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting requests per user (e.g., 1000/hour).
- **Error Handling**: Return standard error codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500) with meaningful messages.
- **Pagination**: Use limit and offset for large datasets (e.g., `/users?limit=10&offset=20`).

### ðŸ”¹ Example: REST API
```json
GET /api/v1/users/123
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

POST /api/v1/users
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
Response: 201 Created
```

### ðŸ”¹ What are Message Queues?
Message queues enable asynchronous communication between services by buffering messages, decoupling producers and consumers.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Patterns
- **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)**: Producers publish messages to topics; subscribers receive them.
- **Point-to-Point**: Messages are sent to a specific consumer via a queue.
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Stores failed messages for later processing.

### ðŸ”¹ Flowchart: Pub/Sub Messaging
```plaintext
+----------+       +------------+       +-------------+
| Producer | ----> | Message    | ----> | Subscriber  |
| (Service)|       | Queue/Topic|       | (Service)   |
+----------+       +------------+       +-------------+
                           |
                           v
                     +-------------+
                     | Dead Letter |
                     | Queue       |
                     +-------------+
```

### ðŸ”¹ Best Practices
